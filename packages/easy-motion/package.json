Speed++\n#### Inspired from [Vim-EasyMotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion) by [Kim Silkeb√¶kken](https://github.com/Lokaltog).\n\nCheck out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.\n\nTo start easy-motion press **Shift+Cmd+E**. Rebind this in settings to better suit you. By default the characters that replace words are **ABC....Z**. You can replace this if you want, also from settings.\n\nExtra commands:\n* **Shift+Cmd+Y** - same word search except it will match the ending of the word\n\nExtra Features:\n* Pressing **Shift+Cmd+E** or **Shift+Cmd+Y** from within the find-and-replace panel will try using easy motion to match the words on the screen, it's faster than pressing enter many times.\n",
